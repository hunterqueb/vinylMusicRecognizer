how to kill process when sshing into the pi


pkill -9 -f vinylSong.py


after first run
    the mic that i have does not pair well with pi0 need to test if it works well with normal pi
        it caused the audio recording to sound very strange
    it takes 2 minutes to get song response from server, so it might not be feasible with my implementation
